# Quick TLDR
Do you want the ability to speak to the dead?
Look no further! Dead players can now speak though ouija boards.

# Features
Adds a UI message system that is used with a ouija board that can be found.

Press 'o' while dead to enable the message popup.
With the UI open, you can type any message (up to 10 characters).
(Spaces will not be counted and will not be written)

You can also use the following shortcut messages (1 movement vs 3/2/7 respectively)
Shortcut messages included:
- y / yes
- n / no
- bye / goodbye
